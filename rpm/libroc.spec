%description

Roc is a toolkit for real-time audio streaming over the network.

Basically, Roc is a network transport, highly specialized for the real-time
streaming use case. The user writes the stream to the one end and reads it from
another end, and Roc deals with all the complexity of the task of delivering
data in time and with no loss. Encoding, decoding, adjusting rates, restoring
losses - all these are performed transparently under the hood.

The project is conceived as a swiss army knife for real-time streaming. It is
designed to support a variety of network protocols, encodings, FEC schemes, and
related features. The user can build custom configurations dedicated for
specific use cases and choose an appropriate compromise between the quality,
robustness, bandwidth, and compatibility issues.
